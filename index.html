            Some things about me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I was born in Vietnam. Living for 16 years, I decided to study in Canada. Now, I am
            a student who is taking CIT course at BCIT. I enjoy playing online game
            during my free time. However, it <em>consumes</em>
            me a lot of time. My current favorite course that I am taking at BCIT is 
            <strong>ACIT-1620</strong>
